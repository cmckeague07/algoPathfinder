# algoPathfinder
**algoPathfinder** is a pathfinding visualizer that demonstrates popular pathfinding algorithms such as:
- **Depth First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**
- **A* Algorithm**

This application is designed to help users understand how pathfinding algorithms work and is built as a practice project to deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

### **Features**
- Visualizes the pathfinding process in real time.
- Interactive interface built with **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Backend logic powered by **Java** and **Spring Boot**.

### **Live Application**
The application is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed here:
**[https://algo-pathfinder-5b2f76b3eadd.herokuapp.com/](https://algo-pathfinder-5b2f76b3eadd.herokuapp.com/)**

Feel free to explore and interact with its functionality!
Simply select a square and click 'visualize' to demonstrate how the alogorithm works to find the desired square. 

### **Important Note**
This app is hosted on Herokuâ€™s **free tier**, which comes with some limitations:
1. **Monthly Dyno Hours**: 
   - Free Heroku apps are allocated **550 dyno hours per month** by default.
   - Dyno hours are consumed whenever the app is running (active or idle).

2. **Idle Apps**:
   - Apps go to sleep after **30 minutes of inactivity**.
   - When the app is accessed after sleeping, there may be a slight delay while it wakes up.

3. **No Guaranteed Uptime**:
   - Free-tier apps are not guaranteed 24/7 availability. If the monthly dyno hour limit is reached, the app will stop until the next billing cycle (1st of the month).


If you encounter any issues accessing the application, these limitations might be the cause.
